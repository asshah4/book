# Package Development {#package}

[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) supports the publishing of open-source packages in `R`. The workflow on package development is improved by the following supporting packages:

- `devtools`
- `pkgdown`
- `usethis`
- `testthat`
- `roxygen`
- `hardhat` (creating modeling functions)

In addition, __git__ and [Github](https://github.com/) are fundamental for version control in the development process. These resources were used in the development of my first package, [`card`](https://asshah4.github.io/card).

## Documenting a Package

The use of `roxygen` is fundamental in the process of package development, forcing explanatory variables and parameters to be documented as functions are developed.

### Website

The package `pkgdown` helps turn documentation into a visually attractive and navigable website. 

In addition, in the fashion of `R`, package logos are developed with a [hexagon-framed sticker](http://hexb.in/), representing a package. The development of a hex sticker is aided by the use of:
