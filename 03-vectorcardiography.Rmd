# Vectorcardiography

The movement of electricity around the heart is at times more revealing then a specific diagnosis. Clinically, relevant vector/morphology based features include:

- vector gradient
- primary versus secondary T-wave abnormalities 
- atrial abnormalities
- identify foci of ectopy

## Computational Approach

Global electrical heterogeneity.
