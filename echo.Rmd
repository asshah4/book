# Echocardiography {#echo}

Echocardiography is a tool used to analyze the function of the heart dynamically. It uses ultrasonography to evaluate the heart, and with the advent of doppler, can assess movement.  

## Pressure gradients

In echocardiography, relative velocity and known chamber sizes can help assess pressure of blood as it moves through the heart, which help to assess two important cardiac capacities:

- inotropy: the ability of the heart to contract
- lusitropy: the ability of the heart to relax
