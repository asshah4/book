This is likely a living book that will change over time. There will be likely several sections technical: involving Rmarkdown, Github, Vim, MATLAB physiology: medically related topics ecg: concepts taken from signal processing efforts, including morphology and heart rate variability analyses This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocâ€™s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. 1.1 This project is built with several libraries from CRAN bookdown pkgdown "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Overview", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Overview This is a collection of posts built using R, serving as documentation for my current clinical and research workflow. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
