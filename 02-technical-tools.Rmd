# Technical Tools {#tech}

When working between Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, having a similar experience is important to maintain workflows. Key features that make the workflow similar are:

- linux kernel (WSL-2)
- terminal (iTerm2, wsltty)
- package manager (homebrew)
- shell (zsh, bash)
- tiling system (tmux)
- email (neomutt)
- version control (github)
- programming (R and RStudio)

## R

Built using _R_. Currently using `R.version`.

## Github

Maintained and version controlled using _git_. 

## Terminal

Tmux - a screen multiplexer with a powerline bar to make a pleasant experience across systems.
